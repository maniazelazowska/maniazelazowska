### Hello to everyone who comes across, as I have no idea how you did it!

<!--
**maniazelazowska/maniazelazowska** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: pretty much everything that isn't my field of expertise.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use this website.
- 📫 How to reach me: currently unable to as this is nothing but my personal field of training
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her, he/him, whichever you prefer
- ⚡ Fun fact: majoring in japanese studies was the biggest mistake of my life, but I don't regret it one bit!
