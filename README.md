- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: pretty much everything that isn't my field of expertise.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use this website.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: currently unable to as this is nothing but my personal field of training.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her, he/him, whichever you prefer.
- âš¡ Fun fact: majoring in japanese studies was the biggest mistake of my life, but I don't regret it one bit!
